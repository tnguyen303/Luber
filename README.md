This app is designed for a community of people who want to catch a taxi and for anyone who would like to get paid to drive in their free time (driver participation coming soon). This project is open-source that means it allows the community to contribute towards a better solution and also the app is non-profit!

Drivers keep almost ALL their earnings + tips (API & server maintaining costs are published.) while riders are served with pleasant rides. This is achieved by our stringent policy on driver background check, as well as drivers' courteousness.
